# CloudNote - FrontEnd

CloudNote is a secure, cloud-based Note keeping application. User can Sign Up/Log in with the email and password. User can add/edit/delete their notes in this application. The Application is built on MERN stack (MongoDB Atlas, Next JS, Express JS). It uses **password hash-encryption** to protect user passwords, **JWT tokens** for user authentication and **NextAuth (Authjs.dev)** for session management. All the data stored in MongoDB Atlas on Cloud so that user data is available everywhere. The Backend server used **REST API** for data handling. The backend server uses **Prisma** ORM for data handling with MongoDB.

This repository is the frontend portion of the CloudNote application. The frontend UI is created using Next JS and designed with Tailwind CSS frameworks.

The newly implemented Next JS app router is used to build the frontend.
